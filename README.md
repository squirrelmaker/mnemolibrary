# Mnemos' Library

Mnemos' Library is learning software based on mnemonics with flashcards, staged review and novel content creation tools integrating Wikipedia.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

Future goals include 
- support for voice platforms including Google Home, Alexa, Snips and Mycroft.
- using the ntlk/spacey frameworks to further enhance content creation and gain additional data to support gamification outcomes like crosswords.

For a working example see https://mnemolibrary.com


## Technology

Mnemos' Library uses react for front end development, node.js (using create-react-app) for web services and MongoDB as a persistence layer.

The library integrates an oauth server into it's web services to support login in anticipation of third party integration including voice platforms.

The library relies on Amazon S3 for storage of uploaded media files and backups.


## Quickstart
The services are easily deployed using docker. An example docker-compose.yml is available in this repository.


## Model

The primary collections in the MongoDB store are questions and words(tags).

To support tracking user progress there are
- seen
- successes
- userquestionprogress

Other collections include
- users
- oauth*
- reportedproblems
- userTopics for staging user created questions before publishing into the questions table
- topicCollections for manual control of the Search page layout.


The application supports import of questions from a Google spreadsheet. Administrators of the application can click the Import button to update questions from the spreadsheet. When complete a spreadsheet is downloaded that includes ids for any new questions. !!IT IS IMPORTANT TO COPY AND PASTE THE CONTENT OF THIS FILE BACK TO THE GOOGLE SHEET OR THE IDS OF THE NEW QUESTIONS WILL CHANGE AT EVERY IMPORT AFFECTING LINKING.


## Access Controlled Quizzes

Access controlled quizzes can be created by users by ticking the restricted box and entering a password in the Create Topic page.

When the (community) topic is published, for each question in the topic
- the access field is set to restricted
- the topicpassword field is set from the topic

When a topic is access controlled, visiting the /discover/topic or /discover/searchtopic (Load Complete Topic) paths results in the user being asked for a password before showing the questions.
!!! this only works for userTopics (can't add topicpassword to questions in spreadsheet)

The entered password is saved in the user record
as the topicPasswords field
ie
```` 
"topicPasswords": {
        "TastyKristopher's australian wattles": "acacia"
    }
````

Discover and search questions are restricted by default to access=="public".
Where there is a user, this criteria is expanded to include 
- questions with access=="<user._id>"  (their own questions)
- questions with access=="restricted" where user.topicPasswords field includes a key matching the question quiz field.


Restricted questions/topics cannot appear in the review or profile page unless the user has access to discover or search for them so no additional filters are applied to review search.
 


## Filters for common queries

- access?
- topic/topics

### Discover
- seen

### Review
- userquestionprogress

### Search




## NPM management

bad packages will crash container so need to start manually to allow npm install

docker stop syn; docker rm syn; docker run --name syn -it -v /var/docker/mnemolibrary:/usr/src/app  --entrypoint /bin/bash syntithenai/nemo 


# Skill config
endpoint https://alexa.mnemolibrary.com/mnemoslibrary


https://mnemolibrary.com/?oauth=alexa
https://auth.mnemolibrary.com/oauth/token
application/secret

http basic

profile

home.syntithenai.com
auth.mnemolibrary.com


## Backup




A backup script is included in this repository that will create a backup and upload it to Amazon S3.

The script needs to be run inside the MongoDB container so it has access to mongodump.

```docker exec <containername>

- crosswords

- mongo-express for developers to manipulate the databse

The login system is provided using an Open Auth server based on https://github.com/oauthjs/node-oauth2-server and the excellent v3 example https://github.com/slavab89/oauth2-server-example-mongodb for using mongodb as a back end.


# TODO
- refresh on access token timeout
- trial authenticate


// to insteall npm packages on live sserver (when non starting)
docker run -v /var/docker/mnemolibrary:/usr/src/app --entrypoint=/bin/bash -it syntithenai/nemo
